# RecipeRandomizer
Worked with a partner to create a Recipe Suggestion Application. Utilising a cleaned dataset of recipes and their ingredients, developed a probability-based prediction algorithm that would deconstruct recipes by ingredients and suggest users recipes based on their preferences. Created an interactive GUI using the StdDraw class.
